## ‚ú® Features

-   **Classic Tetris Logic**: Features all seven traditional tetromino shapes (I, O, T, L, J, S, Z).
-   **HTML5 Canvas Rendering**: The entire game board and all pieces are dynamically drawn on an HTML5 canvas, ensuring high performance.
-   **Progressive Difficulty**: The falling speed of the pieces increases every 30 seconds to challenge the player.
-   **Scoring & Timer**: A real-time scoreboard tracks points for clearing lines, and a timer shows the duration of the current session.
-   **Responsive Controls**:
    -   **Desktop**: Play using the arrow keys (`‚Üê`, `‚Üí`, `‚Üì` for movement, `‚Üë` for rotation).
    -   **Mobile**: On-screen touch controls are provided for mobile devices.
-   **Sleek Visuals**: A retro-futuristic theme with 3D-styled blocks and a clean HUD.
-   **Game Over Notifications**: A "toast" notification elegantly informs the user when the game is over.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

As a MERN stack developer, I see several exciting possibilities to scale this project:

-   **Real-time Multiplayer**: Rebuild the backend using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.IO** to allow two players to compete in real-time.
-   **Global Leaderboard**: Use a **MongoDB** or **Redis** database to store high scores and create a global leaderboard.
-   **React Frontend**: Convert the UI to React to better manage complex game states, such as a "hold piece" feature, "next piece" previews, and player settings.
-   **Advanced Features**: Implement gameplay mechanics like "ghost piece" previews, T-spins, and different game modes (e.g., Sprint, Marathon).
